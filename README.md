# Multi-Stage-Queries-with-MRL
This project implements multi-query retrieval using Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) embeddings with `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large`. The embeddings are stored and queried using the Qdrant vector database.

## Introduction

In this project, we leverage Matryoshka Representation Learning embeddings for efficient multi-query retrieval. The embeddings are generated using `text-embedding-3-small` and `text-embedding-3-large` models and stored in the Qdrant vector database. This approach allows for scalable and accurate retrieval of relevant information from large datasets.
